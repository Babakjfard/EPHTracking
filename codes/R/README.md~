# Description

This repository contains files that are used to process raw data into summaries to be submitted to CDC Data calls


# Last Update

The latest data call was spring 2023 that contained Drinking Water and Radeon data.

# Description of files

- ***functions_Drinking_Water_2023.R:*** includes required functions to create the summary file from raw data
- ***summarize_Drinking_Water_2023.R:*** the main executable file that will create the summary file along with a .doc report.
   The user can change the address of the input and output files in the code.

   Note: The raw data is expected to have a certain structure of minimum required columns with specific namings. ***summarize_Drinking_Water_2023.R:*** checks for this requirement at the start and will stop (with a message) if the raw data does not include the required columns. We suggest to do the validation and correct the potential problems before summarizing your data. The related codes are in the ***python*** folder.
